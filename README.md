This is a standlone voxel renderer that uses greedy meshing to generate a simplified mesh of a voxel world.

This project uses Silk.NET so it *should* be cross-platform, but I've only tested it on Windows.

**Fork**: \
On linux run `sudo apt install libglfw3` to install the required library.

Key files:

- `ChunkMeshActual.cs` contains the greedy meshing algorithm
- `Program.cs` contains the main entry point
- `Client.cs` contains the render loop
